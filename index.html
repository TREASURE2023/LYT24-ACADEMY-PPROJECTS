    <h3>Dear Sir/Ma,</h3>
    <h3> <center> A LETTER OF APPRECIATION </center> </h3>
    <P>
        The world is evolving and we are currently in the technology era and only peoople who have gained the skills and are technologically inclined 
        would thrive successfully in this present world and this is the major reason I decided to take a course in 
        software engineering as one of the leading fields in technology. 
        Amongst other reasons for taking up this course is my strong passion for coding and tech.
            <br>
            <br>
        There is a high demand for software engineers across various industries. 
        Software engineering offer remote jobs whichn are flexible and this means I can work at the 
        comfort of my home while earning good salaries.
            <br>
            <br>
        Moreover, I would not achieve any of the things above if there is no opportunity to learn 
        so I want to use this medium to thank the LYT24 Academy for giving me this big opportunity to learn software engineering, 
        I am not taking it for granted and I promise to put in my best to ensure that I make good use of this opportunity.  
        and fulfill my heart desires of becoming a software engineer in the nearest future. 
        I look forward to a successful learning journey in LYT24 academy.
    </P>
            <br>
